def calculate_iou(boxA, boxB):
    """
    Calculate the Intersection over Union (IoU) between two bounding boxes.

    The IoU is a metric used to evaluate how much two bounding boxes overlap. It is computed
    as the ratio between the area of overlap (intersection) and the total area covered by the
    two boxes (union). This metric is widely used in object detection tasks to determine the
    quality of predicted bounding boxes with respect to the ground truth.

    The computation is performed as follows:
      1. Extract the x and y coordinates along with width and height for both bounding boxes.
      2. Determine the coordinates of the intersection rectangle
      3. Compute the width and height of the intersection region as the difference between these coordinates.
      4. If the computed width or height is negative, it indicates no overlap; in such cases, the intersection area is set to zero.
      5. Calculate the area of the intersection region by multiplying the width and height.
      6. Compute the area of each bounding box individually.
      7. Calculate the union area as the sum of the two bounding box areas minus the intersection area.
      8. Finally, compute the IoU by dividing the intersection area by the union area. If the union area is zero,
         the function returns 0 to avoid division by zero.

    Parameters
    ----------
    boxA : tuple
        A tuple of four numbers representing the first bounding box in the format (x, y, w, h),
        where (x, y) represents the top-left corner, and w and h represent the width and height.
    boxB : tuple
        A tuple of four numbers representing the second bounding box in the format (x, y, w, h).

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The IoU value, which is the ratio of the intersection area over the union area.
        The value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no overlap and 1 indicates perfect overlap.

    """
    Evaluate detections by matching predicted bounding boxes with ground truth boxes and generate
    corresponding true labels and prediction scores for further evaluation (e.g., computing mAP).

    This function processes multiple images and performs the following steps for each image:
      1. Extract detection and ground truth data.
      2. Compute an IoU (Intersection over Union) matrix between each detected box and each ground truth box.
      3. For each detection, determine the maximum IoU with any ground truth box.
      4. Identify valid matches.
      5. Assign prediction scores (pred_scores) and true labels (y_true) for each detection.

    The function supports three evaluation modes specified by the `eval_type` parameter:
      - "objectness": Use objectness scores derived from the `scores` parameter. 
                      This will be evaluated as a binary task (i.e., object vs no object).
      - "class_scores": Use classification scores provided in the `cls_scores` parameter.
                        This will be evalauted as a multi-class task (i.e., One-vs-Rest).
      - "combined": Use the element-wise product of the objectness and classification scores.
                    This will be evalauted as a multi-class task (i.e., One-vs-Rest).

    Parameters
    ----------
    boxes : list
        A list of detected bounding boxes for each image. Each element of the list corresponds to one image
        and is itself a list of tuples, with each tuple representing a detection box in the format (x, y, w, h) 
        as (top-left x, top-left y, width, height).
    classes : list
        A list of detected class labels for each image. Each element is a list of class labels corresponding
        to the detection boxes in the same image.
    scores : list
        A list of detection confidence scores for each image. Each element is a list of confidence scores
        corresponding to the detection boxes in that image.
    cls_scores : list
        A list of classification scores for detected objects for each image. Each element is a list (or array)
        of classification scores (or score vectors) associated with the detections.
    gt_boxes : list
        A list of ground truth bounding boxes for each image. Each element is a list of tuples, with each tuple
        representing a ground truth box in the format (x, y, w, h) as (top-left x, top-left y, width, height).
    gt_classes : list
        A list of ground truth class labels for each image. Each element is a list of labels corresponding to the
        ground truth boxes in that image.
    map_iou_threshold : float
        The IoU threshold used to determine whether a detection matches a ground truth box.
    eval_type : str, optional
        The type of evaluation to perform, which determines which scores are used for predictions.
        Options are:
          - "objectness": Use the objectness scores derived from the `scores` parameter.
          - "class_scores": Use the classification scores provided in `cls_scores`.
          - "combined": Use the element-wise product of the objectness and classification scores. (See example below)
        Default is "class_scores".

    Returns
    -------
    y_true : list
        A list of true labels corresponding to each detection or ground truth match. For detections that match
        a ground truth box, the true label is taken from the ground truth. For false negatives (missed detections),
        the corresponding ground truth label is added.
    pred_scores : list
        A list of predicted scores corresponding to the labels in `y_true`. The scores are derived based on the
        selected evaluation type ("objectness", "class_scores", or "combined"). Dummy scores are assigned for false negatives.
    
    Notes
    -----
    - The function uses IoU matching to determine whether a detection sufficiently overlaps with a ground truth box.
    - The specific handling of scores (e.g., weighting by objectness and/or classification) is determined by the eval_type.

    Compute the precision-recall curve for each class in a multi-class classification task.

    This function takes the true labels and the predicted confidence scores for each class,
    then calculates the precision and recall values at various threshold levels for each class.
    The thresholds are determined by sorting the predicted scores in descending order. For every
    unique threshold (each predicted score in the sorted order), the function computes the number
    of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) to derive the precision
    (TP / (TP + FP)) and recall (TP / (TP + FN)). 

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        True class labels for each sample. Each element should be an integer representing the correct class.
    pred_scores : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_classes)
        Predicted scores or confidence values for each class, for every sample. Each row should correspond
        to a sample, and each column corresponds to one of the classes. Higher scores indicate a higher
        confidence in the prediction for that class.
    num_classes : int, optional
        The total number of classes. This parameter is used to binarize the true labels and to iterate
        over each class when computing the precision and recall curves. Default is 20 for TechTrack.

    Returns
    -------
    precision : dict
        A dictionary where each key is a class index (from 0 to num_classes-1) and the corresponding value
        is a list of precision values computed at various score thresholds. The precision is calculated as
        TP / (TP + FP) at each threshold.
    recall : dict
        A dictionary where each key is a class index (from 0 to num_classes-1) and the corresponding value
        is a list of recall values computed at various score thresholds. The recall is calculated as
        TP / (TP + FN) at each threshold.
    thresholds : dict
        A dictionary where each key is a class index (from 0 to num_classes-1) and the corresponding value
        is a numpy array of threshold values (sorted in descending order, with an extra 0 appended) used to
        compute the precision and recall for that class.

    Notes
    -----
    - The true labels are first binarized using `label_binarize` from scikit-learn to facilitate
      per-class evaluation.
    - For each class, predicted scores are sorted in descending order, and the true binary labels are
      rearranged accordingly.
    - The precision and recall are computed iteratively: for each threshold, the counts of true positives,
      false positives, and false negatives are updated, and the corresponding precision and recall are computed.
    - This function assumes that higher predicted scores correspond to a higher likelihood that the sample
      belongs to the class.

    Calculate the Mean Average Precision (mAP) using x-point interpolation for multi-class object detection tasks.

    This function computes the average precision for each class by interpolating the precision values at a fixed
    number of recall thresholds (default is 11, corresponding to recall levels from 0.0 to 1.0 in increments of 0.1).
    For each class, the precision-recall curve is first sorted in descending order by precision. Then, for each
    recall threshold, the maximum precision for all recall values greater than or equal to the threshold is selected.
    The average precision for a class is the mean of these interpolated precision values, and the mAP is the average
    of the average precisions across all classes.

            It is assumed that these points are generated from detection evaluations and that the list is not necessarily sorted.
    num_classes : int
